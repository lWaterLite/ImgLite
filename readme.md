## Introduction

The application is based on front-back stage decoupling mode. 
The foreground is developed with Vue3, while the background is developed with Django4.

This is a test project for my study of Django, so bugs can't be avoided. If you have any comments or suggestions, please contact me with <lwaterlite@126.com.>

If you are just looking for an online image hosting site, visit mine at [ImgList](http://imglite.lwaterlite.cc). Be advised that this site is in Chinese mainland.

If you want to build your self site, check more details in Vue folder and Django folder.
